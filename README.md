# Naiadis Ambigram Logo Project

## Features

### Logo Design

The centerpiece is a specially designed ambigram. When rotated 180 degrees, the logo maintains its readability, spelling "Naiadis" in both orientations, creating a perfect symmetry.

### Responsive Design

The logo incorporates responsive behavior to maintain optimal visual impact across various screen sizes:

- **Large Screens**: The full logo is displayed with all design elements and details
- **Medium Screens**: Side elements are hidden to focus on the core logo components
- **Small Screens**: Mid-detail elements are removed for a cleaner appearance
- **Extra Small Screens**: Further simplified for minimal but effective branding

### Interactive Elements

#### Dark/Light Mode Toggle

The project includes a sun/moon toggle switch in the top right corner that allows users to switch between:

- **Light Mode**: Clean, bright background ideal for daytime viewing
- **Dark Mode**: Rich, dark background with animated stars for evening viewing

#### Infinity Symbol Button

The infinity symbol button serves both a practical and conceptual purpose:

- **Practical**: Clicking the infinity button rotates the main logo 180 degrees
- **Conceptual**: Demonstrates how the ambigram maintains its readability when inverted
- **Interactive**: Provides users with a hands-on way to experience the ambigram's dual-readable nature

## Technical Implementation

The project is built using standard web technologies:

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for the page and logo elements
- **CSS3**: Responsive design, animations, and theme switching capability
- **JavaScript**: Interactive functionality for the dark/light mode toggle and infinity button

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is used for all graphical elements, ensuring crisp rendering at any scale and enabling the responsive behavior of the logo through CSS media queries.
